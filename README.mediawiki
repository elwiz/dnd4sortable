= About =

Dnd4sortable is a [http://jqueryui.com/ jQuery UI] widget designed to work together with the [http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ sortable] widget. The dnd4sortable widget simulates element moving while the user drags an external element over a sortable list. External elements include:

* files
* bookmarks
* parts of web pages.

This is different from what can be done using the draggable widget. The draggable widget allows the user to add local DOM nodes to the sortable widget. Using the dnd4sortable widget you can implement fast and simple file uploaders or bookmark imports. Just look how easy it can be:

= Usage =

Here is a sample HTML structure:

<pre>
<ul id="sortable">
    <li>this</li>
    <li>list</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>sortable</li>
</ul>
</pre>

And the JavaScript required to enable the sortable and the dnd4sortable widgets:

<pre>
// sortable
$('#sortable').sortable();

// dnd4sortable
$('#sortable').dnd4sortable();
</pre>

This is the simplest way to do it. More can be achieved using the options parameter.

= Options =

The widgets behaviour can be customized using the options parameter. Sample usage looks like this:

<pre>
$('#sortable').dnd4sortable({
    dummyTag: 'div',
    dummyText: '(new)'
});
</pre>

Available options:

* dummyTag - Defines the tag name of the node that will be added when the dragging will start, the dummy tag should be equal to all tags available inside the sortable component. Default value is '''li'''.
* dummyText - Defines the text that will be inserted into the dummy tag when it is created. The dummy text will be visible at least till the file is dropped on the sortable component. Default value is '''...'''.
* drop - Callback function executed when the file is dropped on the sortable component. The callback function takes one parameter - the event object. The callback is executed with the widget available as the ''this'' variable.  Default callback is '''an empty function'''.

The dnd4sortable widget has additional methods:

* dummy - This function returns the last dummy tag created by the widget. The dummy will represent the newly added node when the file is dropped. Use the object returned by the dummy to alter the newly added element.
* revert - This functions performs a rollback operation on the sortable component. It can be used to remove the last dummy node (i.e. when the file upload fails).

Those methods can be called by typing:

<pre>
// globally:
$('selector-to-the-sortable-component').dnd4sortable('dummy');

// in the drop callback:
this.revert();
</pre>
